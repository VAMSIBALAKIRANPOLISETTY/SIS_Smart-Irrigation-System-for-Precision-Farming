🌾 Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming
📖 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-enabled automated irrigation system designed to modernize traditional farming techniques. By utilizing the ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller and various environmental sensors, the system intelligently monitors soil conditions and automates the watering process. This solution aims to conserve water, reduce manual labor, and ensure optimal plant growth through precision agriculture.

🚀 Key Features
Automated Watering: The system automatically activates the water pump when soil moisture drops below a specific threshold.

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks Soil Moisture levels, Temperature, and Humidity (using DHT11).

Mobile Control: Includes a custom-built Android App (Java) that allows users to view live data and manually toggle the pump from anywhere.

Efficient Power Management: Designed to operate with a buck converter for stable voltage regulation.
